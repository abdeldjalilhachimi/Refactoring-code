# Refactoring Codebase given

I have just refactored the code base and make it readable and cleaner

- Using ES6+ Syntax.
- According to the Single Responsibility Principle, I made each function has to only do one thing.
- Generalizing functions.

## Installation

Use Git Clone to install the project on your own machine.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/abdeldjalilhachimi/Refactoring-code.git
```

## Testing

you can test some functions using jest in order to do so

```bash
npm install --save-dev jest
```

After that, you can run

```bash
npm test
```
